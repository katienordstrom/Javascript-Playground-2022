console.log("Hello World")
// TODO this is my to do list

// NOTE this is my first note
/*
Today i created app.js in my own src folder. in order to create this i added node.js. 
We learnt how to install things into our code from npm. 
im not feeling the most confident with this so need to come back to it for revison. to create package.json we used npm init -y 
-y is a flag for a default copy.
